  <h2> Introduction and Overview</h2>
<p>This code is a TypeScript program that uses the Redlock library to implement locking with custom retry strategy for a distributed cache system using Ioredis and RedisJS clients. The program initializes both Ioredis and RedisJS clients, combines them into an array of clients, and then initializes a Redlock instance with these clients. It then attempts to acquire a lock on the specified resource with a custom retry strategy, renews the lock, verifies if the lock&#39;s TTL was updated and if the value is correct, and finally releases the lock.</p>
<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p>The code uses the Redlock library to implement locking for the distributed cache system. The Redlock library provides a high-level abstraction for managing locks in a distributed environment using multiple caching clients (in this case, Ioredis and RedisJS). The system architecture is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redlock Library</strong>: Provides an interface for managing locks with custom retry strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Ioredis Clients</strong>: Caching clients that use the Ioredis library to connect to a Redis server.</li>
<li><strong>RedisJS Clients</strong>: Caching clients that use the RedisJS library to connect to a Redis server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Design</h2>
<p>The data design in this code involves the use of Redis keys and values. The Redlock library uses these keys and values to manage locks in a distributed environment. The key used in this code is <code>locks:example</code>, and the value is generated by the Redlock library. The Redlock library also provides methods for getting the TTL (time-to-live) of a lock, checking if the lock&#39;s value matches, and releasing the lock.</p>
<h2>Interface Design</h2>
<p>The interface design in this code involves working with the Redlock library and the Ioredis and RedisJS clients to manage locks. The Redlock library provides methods for acquiring locks, renewing locks, verifying if the lock&#39;s value matches, and releasing locks. The Ioredis and RedisJS clients provide methods for connecting to a Redis server, getting TTL of a lock, checking if the lock&#39;s value matches, and releasing the lock.</p>
<h2>Component Design</h2>
<p>The component design in this code involves working with both Ioredis and RedisJS clients, as well as the Redlock library to manage locks. The code initializes an array of Ioredis and RedisJS clients, combines them into a single array of clients, and then initializes a Redlock instance with these clients. The Redlock instance is used to acquire, renew, verify if the lock&#39;s value matches, and release locks.</p>
<h2>User Interface Design</h2>
<p>The user interface design in this code involves working with the console output to indicate the status of the locking operation. If the lock is acquired successfully, the program outputs a message indicating that the lock was acquired. If the lock is renewed successfully, the program outputs a message indicating that the lock was renewed. If the lock&#39;s TTL has been extended and if the value is correct, the program outputs a message indicating that the lock TTL was successfully renewed and the value matches. If any error occurs, the program outputs an error message.</p>
<h2>Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Redlock library provides a high-level abstraction for managing locks in a distributed environment using multiple caching clients.</li>
<li>Ioredis and RedisJS clients are used to connect to a Redis server.</li>
<li>The program assumes that the locking operation is performed on the specified resource with a custom retry strategy.</li>
<li>The program relies on the Redlock library&#39;s methods for getting TTL of a lock, checking if the lock&#39;s value matches, and releasing the lock.</li>
<li>The program relies on the Ioredis and RedisJS clients&#39; methods for connecting to a Redis server, getting TTL of a lock, checking if the lock&#39;s value matches, and releasing the lock.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redlock</strong>: A library for managing locks in a distributed environment using multiple caching clients.</li>
<li><strong>Ioredis</strong>: A popular Redis client library for Node.js.</li>
<li><strong>RedisJS</strong>: A Redis client library for Node.js that provides an interface similar to Ioredis, but with additional features and better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Lock</strong>: A mechanism used in distributed systems to prevent race conditions when multiple processes or threads access shared resources concurrently.</li>
<li><strong>Retry Strategy</strong>: An algorithm used to determine the waiting time between retries in case of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Time-to-Live (TTL)</strong>: The amount of time for which a key and its associated value will be stored in a Redis server before being automatically removed.</li>
<li><strong>Redis Key</strong>: A unique identifier used in Redis to store and retrieve data from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Redis Value</strong>: Data stored in Redis using a key.</li>
